# Django_Resume_Uploader_System
In this repo, we have created a Django resume uploader system. Users can submit their resumes by filling in their information, and they can also edit and enhance their content by correcting grammar and adding emojis wherever needed to make it more attractive! 😃

<h2> 🏡 Home Page: </h2>
In this project, we've created a user-friendly form where users can input basic details, such as their resume. We've added the candidate's name to the left corner for user preferences, providing a personalized touch. Additionally, we've developed an image and document upload system, allowing users to easily upload their photos and any documents they want. 📄🧑📤

<h2> 📄 Database Page:</h2>
Furthermore, we've implemented another option called "Resume View," which prominently displays the user's name in the left corner. When users click on a button, they are redirected to another page where their submitted information, including the uploaded image, is beautifully showcased. Moreover, all the data is securely stored in our database for future reference and access. 📋🖼️

<h2> 🎉 Conclusion: </h2>
In conclusion, our project seamlessly combines functionality and aesthetics, offering users a convenient platform to input their information while maintaining an attractive design. The Resume View option enhances user experience, and the data security aspect ensures user information is safeguarded. We've created a project that's both practical and visually appealing. 🚀🌟
